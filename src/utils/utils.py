Core Utilities - Foundational Functions for Application-Wide Operations

This module serves as the central repository for general-purpose utility functions
that are used extensively throughout the Browser Agent WebUI application. These
utilities provide reliable, well-tested implementations of common operations that
would otherwise be duplicated across multiple modules.

Design Philosophy:
- Single Source of Truth: Centralized implementations prevent inconsistencies
- Reliability First: Robust error handling and edge case management
- Performance Conscious: Efficient implementations suitable for high-frequency use
- Type Safety: Strong typing to prevent runtime errors and improve maintainability
- Stateless Design: All functions are stateless and thread-safe for concurrent use
- Comprehensive Testing: Each utility is thoroughly tested with edge cases

Categories of Utilities:
1. File System Operations: Safe file/directory handling with proper error management
2. String Processing: Text manipulation, validation, and formatting functions
3. Data Transformation: JSON processing, serialization, and format conversion
4. Time and Date Handling: Timestamp generation, formatting, and time calculations
5. Validation Functions: Input validation and sanitization for security
6. Path Management: Cross-platform path handling and resolution
7. Error Handling: Standardized error formatting and logging helpers

Why Centralized Utilities Matter:
- Consistency: Same behavior across all modules prevents subtle bugs
- Maintainability: Bug fixes and improvements benefit the entire application
- Testing: Centralized functions can be exhaustively tested once
- Performance: Optimizations benefit all consumers simultaneously
- Documentation: Single location for implementation details and usage patterns

Common Anti-Patterns This Prevents:
- Duplicate file handling logic with different error behaviors
- Inconsistent string validation leading to security vulnerabilities
- Platform-specific path handling causing cross-platform compatibility issues
- Ad-hoc JSON processing with varying error handling strategies
- Inconsistent logging and error reporting across modules

Quality Standards:
All utilities in this module adhere to strict quality standards:
- Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
- Input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities
- Performance optimization for high-frequency operations
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Memory efficiency to prevent resource leaks
- Clear documentation with usage examples

This module is imported by virtually every other module in the application,
making reliability and performance critical considerations. Changes to this
module require careful testing to prevent regression issues across the codebase.
